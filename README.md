# tensor_dim_restructuring

This code takes a 3D tensor of shape (a, b, c) and constructs a new tensor by grouping every two adjacent slices along the first dimension (a). For each group, it concatenates the values across the b dimension for every c index, resulting in an output tensor of shape (a/2, c, 2*b). The process effectively merges pairs of slices along the first axis and stacks their data side-by-side.
